## Data for the The President's Fiscal Year 2017 Budget
Each year, after the President's State of the Union address, the Office of Management and Budget releases the Administration's Budget, offering proposals on key priorities and newly announced initiatives. This year, for the second consecutive year, we are releasing all of the data included in the President's budget in a machine-readable format here on GitHub. The budget process should be a reflection of our values as a country, so we think it's important that members of the public have as many tools as possible to see the data behind the President's proposals. And, if people are motivated to create their own visualizations or products from the data, they should have that chance as well.

You can see the [full Budget on WhiteHouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/).

## About this Branch

These files can be used to reproduce many of the totals published in the budget and examine unpublished details below the levels of aggregation published in the budget.

The [user guide](USER_GUIDE.md) file contains detailed information about this data, its format, and its limitations. In addition, OMB provides [additional data tables, explanations and other supporting documents](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Supplemental) in XLS format on its website.
